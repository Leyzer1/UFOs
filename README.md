# UFOs Analysis

# Overview

In this challenge we helped Dana create a website about UFO sightings. We did this by using JavaScript and HTML coding. In the website we were able to format the page based on the storyboard provided to us. We used JavaScript functions to display the data in a table then used HTML formatting to organize our website to the specifications. We also included a function that allows us to filter the data table that contains the sightings data. The filters allow the user to narrow down the information they are looking for.

This is the initial storyboard website idea provided by Dana.

- At the top we have the Navigation Bar which can be easily edited to include more menu items.
- The banner with the "The Truth is Out There" was created using the jumbotron function in HTML.
- The next section we divided a table in 4 columns on the left and 8 columns on the right.
  - The left has the header "UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?" and the right contains the article itself.
- Below this we again divide the section into three columns on the right and nine columns on the left.
  - The right side contains the filters; the user can input the information they are looking for and it will auto filter the     table to the right based on what was inputted.

# Summary

Overall the website works well and has all the information we were given but it could be improved in the user interface side and functionality. To begin the website could have more navigation options which will help the users go to different pages and interact with the website more effectively. Secondly, the table initially shows all the data at once which might make the website load slow. If we find a way to make the filters only pull the data when the the users inputs the information it could help make the page not load faster. Also if we make the filters into dropdowns menus it can help the user with knowing what to input, this way we can avoid having user inputting info that might not be in the sightings data.
